# CharRecognition2017

Project by: Tarek Khellaf

This "Intelligent Character Recognition" is the final project for the seminar "Artificial Intelligence and Cultural Heritage" (2016/17) at the University of Cologne.

It is planned to create a program which is capable of recognizing Japanese characters (both Kana and Kanji) in natural images.
This will be achieved by creating a (Deep) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), using trainingsets of the "ETL Character Database" (http://etlcdb.db.aist.go.jp/), Python and (most likely) TensorFlow.

Work on this project is expected to start in mid-February after some further theoretical preparation and a hardware upgrade.

Adjustments to the goal (e.g. Roman alphabet instead of Japanese) are still possible, depending on the pace of progress.

Stay tuned for further information.
